The APOGEE-Joker VAC contains posterior samples for binary-star orbital parameters (Keplerian orbital elements) for 358,350 sources with three or more APOGEE visit spectra that pass a set of quality cuts as described in \citet{Price-Whelan:2021}. The posterior samples are generated using \textit{The Joker}, a custom Monte Carlo sampler designed to handle the multi-modal likelihood functions that arise when inferring orbital parameters with sparsely-sampled or noisy radial velocity time data \citep{Price-Whelan:2017}. This VAC deprecates the previous iterations of the catalog \citep{Price-Whelan:2018, Price-Whelan:2020}.

For 2,819 stars, the orbital parameters are well constrained, and the returned samples are effectively unimodal in period. For these cases, we use the sample(s) returned from \textit{The Joker} to initialize standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the Keplerian parameters using the \textit{exoplanet} \citep{exoplanet} and provide these MCMC samples. For all stars, we provide a catalog containing metadata about the samplings, such as the maximum \textit{a posteriori} (MAP) parameter values and sample statistics for the MAP sample.

\citet{Price-Whelan:2021} describes the data analysis procedure in more detail, and defines and analyzes a catalog of $\gtrsim$40,000 binary star systems selected using the raw orbital parameter samples released in this VAC.
